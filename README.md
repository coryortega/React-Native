## This project is an improvement on my previous project, [Sound Drip](https://github.com/coryortega/SoundDripFE), and is a work in progress

### TODO:
- [x] Replace current state management (useContext) with Redux
- [x] Get dynamic visualization chart working
- [] Currently handeling auth client-side, need to move code/token exchange server-side
- [] Bring in DS songs, concatenate them and collectively fetch track data from Spotify
- [] Define more Spotify functionality in api/index (prevTrack, nextTrack, createPlaylist, like/unlike, etc.)
- [] Set up refresh token functionality when token is about to expire
- [] Swap AsyncStorage with [expo-secure-store](https://docs.expo.io/guides/authentication/#storing-data)
