## This project is an improvement on my previous project, [Sound Drip](https://github.com/coryortega/SoundDripFE) and is a **work in progress**

### TODO:
- Replace current state management (useContext) with Redux
- Currently handeling auth client-side, need to move code/token exchange server-side
- Define more Spotify functionality in api/index
- Swap AsyncStorage with [expo-secure-store](https://docs.expo.io/guides/authentication/#storing-data)
